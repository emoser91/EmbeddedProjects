/* I asked OpenAI GPT to "write a pid controller in c" and this was the output:

	A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a type of feedback control system 
	that uses the proportional, integral, and derivative terms of a control signal to correct 
	the error between a desired setpoint and the actual output of the system.

	Here is a simple implementation of a PID controller in C:

	This program defines the compute_control() function, which computes the control signal 
	using the PID controller equations. It also defines the main int main() function, which 
	sets the PID controller parameters, sampling time, setpoint, and initial output, and then 
	calls the compute_control() function to compute and output the control signal.

	Note that this is a very simple implementation of a PID controller, and it does not include 
	any actual control of a system. It only computes the control signal based on the setpoint and 
	output values that are provided. To use this PID controller in a real control system, you would 
	need to integrate it with the system and use the control signal to adjust the system's output.
